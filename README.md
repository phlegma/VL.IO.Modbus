# VL.IO.Modbus

This is a VL wrapper for the [FluentModbus](https://github.com/Apollo3zehn/FluentModbus) library, designed for use with vvvv, the visual live-programming environment for .NET: http://visualprogramming.net.  
Currently, only the ModbusTCPClient is wrapped, but other functions can be easily added. More detailed information about the FluentModbus implementation can be found on their [page](https://apollo3zehn.github.io/FluentModbus/).

## Getting Started
